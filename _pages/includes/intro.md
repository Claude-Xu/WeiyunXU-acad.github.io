I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at *MISSION*, Zhang's Research Lab at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Prior to this, I was a research assistant at [Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University](https://me.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) after I got my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from [School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) in June, 2024.

I studied as a graduate student at [State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration](https://msv.sjtu.edu.cn/) and [National Engineering Research Center of Automotive Power and Intelligent Control](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/zdsys/2463.html) in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Ping Zhu](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/FullTimeTeacher/zhuping.html). I also got my bachelor's degree of Mechanical Engineering from SJTU in 2018. I was selected by both Tsien Hsue-shen Program (10% Pass) and Zhiyuan Honor Program (5% Pass) of SJTU, where I was well trained in linear algebra, solid mechanics, and mechanical principles. I won National Scholarship (Top 1%) in 2017, 2019, and 2023, Merit Student Award of SJTU in 2017, and Inspirational Individual Award of SJTU in 2020.

My research interest mainly includes:  <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=szGICn8AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FClaude-Xu%2FWeiyunXU-acad.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>
- **Active matter system** based on programable mechanical metamaterials (lattice, cellular, and TPMS structures, etc.)  
- Data-driven method of **structure-property relationship** investigation and optimization  
- **Functional architected materials** considering composites or multi-material additive manufacturing

<span style="color:red">I envision a future where I can contribute new technologies and ideas to improve human society, life, production and communication. Should you have any collaborative ideas on **smart materials**, **advanced fabrication**, or **AI for science**, please feel free to contact me!</span> [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/email-red)](mailto:weiyunxu@illinois.edu)
