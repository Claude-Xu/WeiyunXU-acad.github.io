I am a Ph.D. student majored in Mechanical Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am now studying at [State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration](https://msv.sjtu.edu.cn/) and [National Engineering Research Center of Automotive Power and Intelligent Control](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/zdsys/2463.html) of [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by [Ping Zhu (朱平)](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher_directory1/zhuping.html). 

Prior to this, I graduated from School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) with a bachelor's degree. I was selected by both Tsien Hsue-shen Program (10% Pass) and Zhiyuan Honor Program (5% Pass) of SJTU, where I was well trained in linear algebra, solid mechanics, and mechanical principles. I won National Scholarship (Top 1%) in 2017, 2019, and 2023, Merit Student Award of SJTU in 2017, and Inspirational Individual Award of SJTU in 2020.

My doctoral research interest mainly includes:  
- the property regulation and design of programable **mechanical metamaterials (lattice, cellular, and porous structures, etc.)**  
- computational method of **structure-property relationship investigation and optimization**  
- **functional metamaterials** considering composites or multi-material **additive manufacturing** with corresponding applications.

<span style="color:red">I am going to get my doctoral degree in June, 2024 as planned. And I am now looking for a postdoctoral fellow position related to the fields of **smart materials**, **advanced fabrication**, and **data-driven engineering**. I envision a future where I can contribute new technologies and ideas to improve human society, life, production and communication. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested.</span> [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/email-red)](mailto:xuweiyunmachinery@sjtu.edu.cn)
