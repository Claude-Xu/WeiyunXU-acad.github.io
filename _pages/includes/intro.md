I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) <img src='./images/SJTU.png' style='width: 6em;'>. I am now studying at [State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration](https://msv.sjtu.edu.cn/) and [National Engineering Research Center of Automotive Power and Intelligent Control](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/zdsys/2463.html) of [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by [Ping Zhu (朱平)](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher_directory1/zhuping.html). 

Prior to this, I graduated with a bachelor's degree from School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I was selected by both Tsien Hsue-shen Program (10% pass) and Zhiyuan Honor Program (5% pass) of SJTU where I was well trained in linear algebra, solid mechanics, and mechanical principles. I won National Scholarship (Top 1%) in 2017 and 2019, Merit Student Award of SJTU in 2017, and Inspirational Individual Award of SJTU in 2020.

My current research interest mainly includes the programable property regulation and design of  **mechanical metamaterials (lattice, cellular, and porous structures, etc.)**, data-driven **structure-property relationship investigation and optimization**, and **functional metamaterials** considering composites or multi-material **additive manufacturing** with corresponding applications.

<span style="color:red">I am going to get my doctoral degree in March, 2024 as planned. And I am now looking for a postdoctoral fellow position that corelates to the field of **metamaterials**, **additive manufacturing**, and **data-driven engineering**. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested. My email is [xuweiyunmachinery@sjtu.edu.cn](mailto:xuweiyunmachinery@sjtu.edu.cn).</span>
