I work at [Bytedance AI Lab, Speech & Audio Team](https://ailab.bytedance.com/) <img src='./images/tiktok.png' style='width: 6em;'> as a research scientist now in Singapore, leading a fundamental audio/talkingface research group. 

I am now working on TTS, music generation, speech translation and audio-driven talking face generation research. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [ren.yi@bytedance.com](mailto:ren.yi@bytedance.com).

I graduated from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/main.htm), Zhejiang University (浙江大学竺可桢学院) with a bachelor's degree and from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University (浙江大学计算机科学与技术学院) with a master's degree, advised by [Zhou Zhao (赵洲)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I also collaborate with [Xu Tan (谭旭)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xuta/), [Tao Qin (秦涛)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/taoqin/) and [Tie-yan Liu (刘铁岩)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tyliu/) from [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-research-group/) <img src='./images/microsoft_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;"> closely. 

I won the [Baidu Scholarship](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6%E5%A5%96%E5%AD%A6%E9%87%91/9929412) (10 candidates worldwide each year) and [ByteDance Scholars Program](https://ur.bytedance.com/scholarship) (10 candidates worldwide each year) in 2020 and was selected as one of [the top 100 AI Chinese new stars](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4NzQ5MTA2NA==&mid=2653639431&idx=1&sn=25b6368c1954419b9090840347d9a27d&chksm=8be75b90bc90d286a5af3ef8e610e822d705dc3cf4382b45e3f14489f3e7ec4fd8c95ed0eceb&mpshare=1&scene=2&srcid=0511LMlj9Qv9DeIZAjMjYAU9&sharer_sharetime=1620731348139&sharer_shareid=631c113940cb81f34895aa25ab14422a#rd) and AI Chinese New Star Outstanding Scholar (10 candidates worldwide each year). 

My research interest includes speech synthesis, neural machine translation and automatic music generation. I have published 50+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4FA6C0AAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD. 

Born and raised in Southern China, Weiyun Xu's growing curiosity towards machinery and computer in his teenage year led himself to the world of science and engineering. Through constant effort, he was admitted to Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) and was selected by both Tsien Hsue-shen Program and Zhiyuan Honor Program of SJTU. After Weiyun Xu got his B.E. degree he began his doctoral studies advised by Prof. Ping Zhu at the State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration, National Engineering Research Center of Automotive Power and Intelligent Control, School of Mechanical Engineering, SJTU. He is well trained in linear algebra, solid mechanics, and mechanical principles, and is good at programing, designing, modeling, and manufacturing and processing.
