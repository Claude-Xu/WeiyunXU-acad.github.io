I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at [*MISSION*, Zhang's Research Lab](https://zhang.cee.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Prior to this, I collaborated with Prof. Peng Wen at [Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University](https://me.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) after I got my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from [School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) in June, 2024.

I was supervised by [Prof. Ping Zhu](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/FullTimeTeacher/zhuping.html) during my integrated MSc and PhD program. I was selected by both Tsien Hsue-shen Program (10% Pass) and Zhiyuan Honor Program (5% Pass) of SJTU, and got my bachelor's degree of Mechanical Engineering from SJTU in 2018. I demonstrated consistent academic excellence throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies, evidenced by receiving the National Scholarship (Top 1%) three times (2017, 2019, 2023), alongside the Merit Student Award (2017) and the Inspirational Individual Award (2020) from SJTU.

My current research interests mainly include:  <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=szGICn8AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FClaude-Xu%2FWeiyunXU-acad.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>
- **Active metamaterials system** based on programable structure-property relationships (lattice, cellular, and TPMS structures, etc.)  
- **Computational mechanics, optimization, and design** for  
- **Functional architected materials** considering composites or multi-material additive manufacturing

<span style="color:red">I envision a future where I can contribute new technologies and ideas to improve human society, life, production and communication. Should you have any collaborative ideas on **smart materials**, **advanced fabrication**, or **AI for science**, please feel free to contact me!</span> [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/email-red)](mailto:weiyunxu@illinois.edu)
